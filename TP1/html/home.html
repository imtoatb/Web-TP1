            <h2>What is Green IT?</h2>
            <p>
                The concept of <strong>digital sobriety</strong>, also known as <strong>green IT</strong>,
                <strong>sustainable IT</strong>, or <strong>eco-IT</strong>, is a relatively new approach to digital
                responsibility and environmental awareness.
            </p>

            <h3>Green IT's Main Objectives:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Minimize energy consumption</li>
                <li>Reduce greenhouse <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" class="gas-emissions">gas emissions</a></li>
            </ol>
        </section>

            <h2>What Impact Does Digital Technology Have on the Environment?</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>carbon footprint</strong> of a digital activity refers to the greenhouse <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" class="gas-emissions">gas emissions</a>
                caused by human use of digital technologies. These emissions are primarily due to the energy used
                by devices, servers, and networks, and they vary depending on the energy sources used.
            </p>
            <p>
                It depends on the emission factors associated with each digital action – especially those linked
                to CO₂ emissions.
            </p>

            <h2>Energy Impact on Web Development</h2>
            <h3>Why Do Websites Have a Carbon Footprint?</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Every website has its own carbon footprint — the total amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" class="gas-emissions">greenhouse gases emissions</a> generated by the process of creating and maintaining it.</li>
                    <li>Your website's carbon footprint corresponds to the amount of CO2 emissions it created during its lifetime.</li>
                    <li>The larger your website's carbon footprint, the greater the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>What Is the Carbon Footprint of a Web Page?</h3>
            <p>                
                <ul>
                    <li>Browsing online and visiting websites requires electrical energy. This has a significant ecological impact.</li>
                    <li>On average, a web page consulted produces <strong>1.76 grams of CO2</strong>, and <strong>7 grams</strong> for a Google search.</li>
                    <li>The design and number of visits to a website largely influence the weight of its carbon emissions.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                Website design and the number of visitors significantly influence the total carbon emissions.
